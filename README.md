My name is Jodson and my background is in communcations. I am especially interested in the concept of statecraft, as it is the most crucial type of communication society deals with. This interest began at Bellarmine where I was exposed, inadvertently, to Catholic staecraft. Fascinated, I've gon on a scholarly journey that has led me here and to do this: https://ntari.org.

I have no clue what I'm doing...
